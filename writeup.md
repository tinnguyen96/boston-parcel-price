Why is predicting parcel's total value important?
For the City: 
- to determine the tax 
    + each year, there are about 160k parcels to price. a good prediction system can reduce the time spent by city officials. 
For owners/real estate companies
- which property is improving in value, which is not? 
    + a couple wants to buy a place, and wants to optimize for future value
- what is the impact of features/renovations on the total value? 
    + among a set of possible renovations, which one gives the most value?

Based on https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment/resource/4973f23e-859e-4190-b308-8223c246147e,
a list of important features to predict the parcel's total value are:
- living area
- year built
- year since remodeling
- number of rooms
- zipcode
